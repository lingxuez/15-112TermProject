# Color Your Data
## CMU 15-112 Term project

My term project for <a href="http://www.kosbie.net/cmu/fall-14/15-112/"> CMU 15-112 </a> (Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science). *(By the way this is a wonderful course that I definitely recommend to everyone!)*

This is an app to help users choose among different color schemes for enhanced data visualization. It also performs a K-means clustering to the data in 2 dimensions. Feel free to check out this 3-minute introduction video I made on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC-PSrx757w"> Youtube</a>!
